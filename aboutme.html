            <p><u>The story of my developer journey</u><br><br>
                
                Be me, starting professional life as a humble curreny trader @ large financial instituion.
                Having studied finance & economics at university, I found the role initially very rewarding and stimulating.
                Over the years, it became clear to me that i'd also be interested to try something different.
                Being still early on in my career at this point, I figured there's no harm to explore other possibilities.
                So, off I went to Canada. (For the 2nd time).

            <img src="/images/Canada.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p>It had been one of my dreams to spend a winter skiing and snowboarding in The Rockies, so... I booked a ticket out to Alberta and chased that.
                I was also on a side mission though - undercover job detective. I ended up working in a restaurant (so I could board during the day), where I was paid to speak to people. AMAZING!
                I asked basically every single person that I served (easily > 2000) what they did for work, what they liked about it, and what they didn't like about it.
                I had some super unexpected answers (eg. shark tank cleaner) and A LOT of food for thought.
            </p>

        <div class="story">
            <p>The resorts closed, so off I went back to Montreal.
                They speak French in Quebec, and my French was <b>not. good.</b> but I had a plan.
                Based upon my research, conversations, personal interests etc i'd come up with a pretty specific idea of what I wanted; 
                something in a small company (having worked in a large one), it had to be primarily in English (at least initially) and lastly in a different industry.
                At this point, I had Montreal tech startups squarely in my sights... but I had no technical skills?

            <p>Turns out, that doesn't matter.
                I ended up being employee ~15 (~40 by the time I left) at a SaaS company called Unito (SaaS integrations & workflow space).
                Most importantly for me, I loved every minute of it. I learned more in my time there, than all of my other professional experiances combined.
                Working with extremely bright & motivated colleagues, I hand my hands on everything from sales (primarily) to marketing and product management.
                I worked closely with every team, developers included. I had the chance to go through Series A fundraising, and really be involved in the tech community.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="story">
            <p class="two">So that brings us to today. I liked working with technology, I liked working with driven individuals and I really took to the inclusive culture.
                Sales is fun, but I was also really drawn to the technical side of the business.
                I wanted to have a deeper understanding of how it works, the logic, solving problems & bridging the gap between client facing & technical teams.
                <br><br>
                So here I am, back in Sydney, taking time away from work to develop those skills. To become a developer -
                and whether that leads me to move into a developer role full time, back into technical sales or even a hyribd role, i'm not entirely sure.
                All i'm sure of, is that i'm excited to see what new opportunites & challenges I can find.
